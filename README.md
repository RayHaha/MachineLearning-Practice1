PLA

It's the question 15 from machine learning course
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml15fall/hw1/hw1.pdf
Implement a version of PLA by visiting examples in the na¨ıve cycle using the order of examples
in the data set. Run the algorithm on the data set. What is the number of updates before the
algorithm halts? What is the index of the example that results in the “last” mistake?
